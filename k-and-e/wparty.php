<h2> Jennifer Chang </h2> 
<i>maid of honor</i> <br>
<img src = "img/jennifer.jpg" align="right" class="right">
	Though Jennifer and I were not always necessarily the best of friends (Jennifer claims to have memories of me chasing her around with scissors), we have always been and will always be sisters. From covertly building forts to watching Sailor Moon, Jennifer has always been a supportive and involved older sister, never letting my relative immaturity get in the way of our sister-ness. Though I am the spoiled younger sister of the relationship, I deeply appreciate Jennifer for loving me despite all my temper tantrums and ridiculous requests! Currently studying in Atlanta, Georgia, Jennifer enjoys traveling, exploring and making different types of food, and shares with me a hatred for spiders. 
	<br> <br> <br>
<h2> Melissa Hua </h2>
<i>bridesmaid</i> <br>
<img src = "img/melissa.jpg" align="left" class="left">
       Growing up, Melissa was an honorary member of the Chang family. One of our favorite childhood memories is when Melissa saved me from "drowning" in her swimming pool. As I yelled for help, Melissa threw a water hose out into the pool to pull me to safety. Both of us were in emotional distress, and were both somehow oblivious to the saving-nature of the inner-tube around my waist. Regardless of my well-being or status, I owe my life to Melissa in more ways than one as Melissa played an instrumental role in helping me transition into high school. Melissa has always been a source of encouragement and wisdom, and I am excited to have her be a part of the wedding day! Currently living in NYC, Melissa enjoys rock climbing, making coffee ice cream with oreo chunks, and dislikes sticky humid weather. 
       <br><br><br><br><br>
<h2> Judy Liang </h2>
<i>bridesmaid</i> <br>
<img src = "img/judy.jpg" align="right" class="right">
	Owner of the "true friend" title, Judy has loyally supported me throughout our friendship, even daring to side against Eric whenever silly arguments or bets arose. Though we lived and grew up within 7 miles of each other, Judy and I did not meet until college, in Ithaca, NY. We became fast friends, sharing many memories of running in the snow, using Judy's baby face to solicit free food, and making bread in a rice cooker. I greatly appreciate Judy's true friendship, and am comforted knowing that I will have a fellow zombie-killer part of my big day! A current resident of Cupertino, CA, Judy enjoys running, being a rebellious registered dietician, and using her laughter as an effective alarm clock. 
      <br><br><br>
<h2> Andrea Chiu </h2>
<i>bridesmaid</i> <br>
<img src = "img/andrea.jpg" align="left" class="left">
	Though Andrea and I grew up going to church together, we did not become friends until summer before high school while taking Chinese at a community college. Even though we never attended the same school, Andrea has always been the better friend, from attending my tennis matches and orchestra concerts in high school to dutifully writing me letters throughout college and even coming all the way to Ithaca for my graduation! Andrea has always been a faithful friend, always ready to listen and eager to offer practical help in any way. Recently married and now living in Irvine, CA, Andrea enjoys taiwanese shaved snow, being an avid Cal fan, and shares with me a love for McD's breakfast sandwiches. 
      <br><br><br><br><br>
<h2>Jonathan Weng</h2>
<i>best man</i><br>
<img src = "img/jonathan.jpg" align="right" class="right">
	Jonathan was nothing special--in fact, my only impressions of Jonathan were of his mother, who taught Sunday school and instilled an unhealthy fear into all the boys in our grade, and the fact that he somehow sported a freakishly pale complexion like mine. As we grew older, we would sport stupid hairdos, strut around like hardcore punks at church, and, back when playing Pokemon was cool and not a socially derided activity, act like the Pokemon masters that we really weren't. While some things may never change, one thing that became evident was how our experiences at church and throughout college molded and shaped our friendship and understanding of Christ. Jonathan has always been the kind, gracious, listening friend that I am not, and I am grateful for having Jonathan to always remind me of the most important things in life. Jonathan is fond of Naruto, working out, and eating excessively quickly, and currently studies in Los Angeles (UCLA) to be one of my future dentists. 
      <br><br>
<h2> Jason Wu</h2>
<i>groomsman</i><br>
<img src = "img/jason.jpg" align="left" class="left">
	Growing up, Jason and I lived only a few blocks away, and so it comes as no surprise that we grew up close friends through commonalities such as being short, glasses-ridden, Asians struggling through the same Chinese school homework. I knew that if I ever needed a friend to count on (or even in one case a friend with whom who I could stay after running away from home), Jason was that fellow. We enjoyed each other's company so much that we were tennis partners until a long string of defeats due to our individual inconsistent styles forced us to split up. Along with a long-standing tradition to treat each another through gifts and birthdays, I'm reminded of how much I cherish Jason's kindness and good-natured heart and am glad Jason will be able to celebrate with me come wedding day. Jason likes art and design, sleeping, and DOTA, and currently studies in Los Angeles (USC) to be another one of my future dentists (sound familiar?).
      <br><br><br>
<h2> Eric Cai</h2>
<i>groomsman</i><br>
<img src = "img/ericcai.jpg" align="right" class="right">
	I first heard about Eric Cai because there were rumblings that someone young whippersnapper had replaced me at youth group as the bestest counselor, ever (jk). When I finally met Eric Cai, those rumors were confirmed, and yet, if there was one young man to do it, I was glad it was he. Though he might possibly say (in his actual words) that "his unrequited love for me began when we were lying down on some grass underneath a moonlit sky strewn with resplendent gleams of stars from far away galaxies" (this has actually happened in a much less Shakespearean manner as part of chaperoning a ministry-related outing), Eric has always been an encouragement and has brought laughter and joy to me, even though he's a troll and a hipster. Eric likes the ESV, hanging out with family, and hating on all sorts of pets, and currently studies in Los Angeles (The Master's Seminary) to become a pastor.
	<br><br>
<h2> Caleb Chan</h2>
<i>groomsman</i><br>
<img src = "img/caleb.jpg" align="left" class="left">
	Caleb and I are, in many ways, very different; in fact, people have even used us to represent opposite extremes of a spectrum or two. And yet perhaps that's why, although it took time, I grew from reluctantly interacting with him into enjoying his presence during my time at Cornell. Though I didn't enjoy playing Halo, basketball, saying things like "sick nasty" or "mad awesome", being 30 minutes late to fellowship, [insert yet another dissimilarity], I did value the fact that Caleb was always maturing as a person, which spurred me on likewise to grow as a brother and a friend. He was one of very few who would speak words to me that I needed, not just the words I wanted to hear,  and would offer the right counsel or encouragement at just the right time. Perhaps I should clone myself a mini-Caleb one day. Caleb enjoys pwning n00bs with b00m headshots, the Giants/Nets/Yankees, and eating fries/unhealthy food, and is studying in New York (SUNY Downstate) to practice medicine.
